# Hunt and Kill maze generator

Generates D&D-style dungeon mazes using Jamis Buck's [Hunt and Kill](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/24/maze-generation-hunt-and-kill-algorithm)
algorithm. The python code is easily tunable to modify the size and sparseness of the generated maze.

By default the generated maze(s) are displayed in a simple pygame window, which will generate a new
maze each time it is clicked.
